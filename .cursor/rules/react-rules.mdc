# Your rule content
- on react components, put the props type in the component file, but for other new types, create them in another file {componentName.types.ts}
- put page components under /src/pages
- When creating new state, make sure to minimize the amount of data you save on the state, and do not have duplicate data on state, use referece id when needed.
- when creating new state, think where is the ideal place for this state to sit, which other components might need to consume it? maybe it should sit on a global context instead.

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
